### but what if we don't know how much time is need for the motion control?

remind myself of the delay(1/speed), which is a common introductory concept for rate control, the current code is implement on the assumption that we set a time limitation and then plan the motion base on it. If we not sure how much time is optimal to do it, then how?

Go from Time-Based Motion Planner to a Constraint-Based Trajectory Generator.the system must first calculate the optimal time T based on the motor's physical and safety limits, and then execute the movement using that calculated time.

The process of the MotionPlanner changes from:

Input: (Δθ,T)→Output: V(t)

so we need to know the max accel, max speed, max jerk etc parameter, and then we can calcualte the estimated time; then we can calculate the minimum possible Total Time (T).

Once T is calculated, the while(1) loop executes the plan: 
```
while (1) {
    // 1. Get the current time t from the system clock
    float current_time = system_clock.getTime();
    
    // 2. The Motion Planner uses t to calculate the smooth, safe setpoint
    float ramped_velocity = planner.update(current_time); // V(t) derived from calculated T
    
    // 3. The PID Controller uses the planned velocity
    float control_signal = pid.update(ramped_velocity, estimated_velocity);
    
    // 4. Send the normalized command
    setMotor(control_signal); 
    
    // 5. Wait until the next time step (1/DT)
    // The fixed DT (e.g., 1ms) is what ensures our time integration is accurate.
}
```

But then, you would think: how do u make sure the robot stop when it's very close to the actual position, but due to sensor noise, the error is never zero but near zero, the robot just keep on adjusting the position around the point? 

I guess this is when dead zone come in handy? A Dead Zone defines a range of acceptable error around the target. If the current error falls within this zone, the controller output is immediately set to zero, effectively telling the motor to stop updating, your job is done.

so we can add sth liek this in the code: 

```
// Define the tolerance (e.g., within 0.1 degree of target)
const float POSITION_DEAD_ZONE = 0.1f; 

float control_signal = 0.0f; 

// --- 1. Decide if the movement is finished ---
float current_position_error = final_target_position - estimated_position;

if (std::abs(current_position_error) < POSITION_DEAD_ZONE) {
    // 1a. We are close enough: Set command to zero and reset the Integral term.
    control_signal = 0.0f;
    pid.reset_integral(); // Prevents integral windup for the next move
} else {
    // 1b. Still outside the dead zone: Use motion planning and PID.

    // 2. Get smooth velocity setpoint (ramped_velocity)
    float ramped_velocity = planner.update(motion_elapsed_time); 

    // 3. Calculate the normalized control signal
    control_signal = pid.update(ramped_velocity, estimated_velocity);
}

// 4. Send the command to the physical motor
setMotor(control_signal); 
```
